# Social-Platform: create a PHP - MySQL app for managing the pictures uploaded by users.

# TASK1: 
* Users have to create their account with a user and password.
* Each user can upload photos to the application. Photos will be visible to other users.
* Other users will be able to post comments on pictures in the application. 

# TASK2: 
* Implement a Like button for each photo, which will allow users to appreciate that picture.
* When the user presses the Like button, the number of likes associated with the picture increases and is visually marked. If the button is pressed again, it means that the user get the unlike function for the picture.
* The total number of likes will appear near the like button.

# TASK3:
* A user's photos are displayed sorted decreasing depending on the number of likes.
* If 2 pictures have the same number of likes, they will be sorted in descending chronological order (most recent first).
* A user can delete pictures from his account. When you delete a photo, it is automatically deleted the associated comments, as well as the likes.
